		You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

Well, I got better. Why do you think that she is a witch? Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

It's only a model. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. He hasn't got shit all over him. Why do you think that she is a witch? Well, I got better.

But you are dressed as one… Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Shut up! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!

Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Why? And the hat. She's a witch! Look, my liege! He hasn't got shit all over him.

Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! It's only a model. I am your king. How do you know she is a witch? Did you dress her up like this?

I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Well, what do you want?

Well, we did do the nose. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Well, she turned me into a newt. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.

He hasn't got shit all over him. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! I dunno. Must be a king. A newt? Where'd you get the coconuts?
